This project is a tool for summarizing news articles using OpenAI's language models.
http://localhost:8502/ app link

Prerequisites
Before running the project, we need to ensure that we have the following dependencies installed: Python (version 3.6 or higher), Streamlit (pip install streamlit), langchain, openai, newsapi. We need to make Openai API Key and NewsAPI Key.

Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
|--app.py

|--langchain_config1.py

|--requirements.txt

|--.streamlit

| |--secrets.toml 

|--.env

|--README.md

|--LLM.pdf

I have stored Openai API key and NewsAPI key in "secrets.toml" file  and .env file so that it can be safe and no one can leak it.

Running the Web App

Navigate to the app/directory and it can be run by running the:

langchain_config1.py(python file) by giving the command "python langchain_config.py"

and then

app.py(python file) by giving the command "streamlit run app.py"
